/**
 * What is this, you ask? This is called a "fragment". It allows you to extend the functionality of your repository
 * classes WITHOUT actually implementing your repository. All you have to do is have your @Repository extend this
 * fragment interface and BAM, Spring magically clobbers the Impl of this interface into your repository class.
 * Remember, the "Impl" postfix on the implementation class is what Spring will look for!
 * For more detail, please see
 * https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/data-commons/docs/current/reference/html/#repositories.single-repository-behavior
 * @param <T> the type of the entity object, similar to the T of the {@code <T, ID>} type params in CrudRepository.
